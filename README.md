## About The Project

Soleseeker is an e-commerce marketplace for sneaker enthusiasts. Built using react and Stripe, users are able to browse, add items to their shopping bag, and checkout using Stripes test checkout system.The app was designed with the primary aim of replicating the functionality of a real shopping cart, achieved through the utilization of React's useContext hook and local storage.

## Future Enhancments

To enhance the authenticity of Soleseeker, I would like to implement user authentication, similar to popular sneaker marketplaces like Goat and StockX. This feature will enable users to create accounts, make postings, and sell their own sneakers.
